## Set-Up
**React Native**: To test the app in your local environment, first follow the [react native Setup]([https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.61/enviroment-setup)) to make sure you have installed the packages for react native, node.js, and expo go.

**Repo**: Clone the Repo into your local directory by running
```
git clone https://github.com/educational-technology-collective/spaced-rep.git
```
## Run
After you have set up the repo in your local directory. Run the following commands to try the app:
```
cd spaced-rep
npm start
```
It should automatically provide you with a list of commands to run the application as well as a QR-Code that you can use your device to scan and run. iPhone 13 ProMax is used for development

## Interact with Cards
### QA-Cards:
You can type in the input box for the answer of QA-Cards. Then you can click the question box of the QA-Card to show the answer. Then you will have four confidence level indications that you can press the button to move on to next card.

### QAImg-Cards:
Same as the QA-Cards above. Just with an Image.

### MCQ-Cards:
You will be given four options for a multiple choice question. You will click the choice you think is correct, and the card will highlight the correct choice with green background color and the incorrect choice with red backrgound color, covering all the other choices. Then, you also press the button of one of the four buttons to move on to next card.
